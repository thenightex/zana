### Things it can do
1. Link items in chat, syntax is similar to the reddit bot, i.e enclose item name inside [[]]
  - It can link anything poe related that is an ingame "Item", this means, hideout doodads, prophecies, gems, items, currency
    - This is a feature of the PoE.py lib which if you are working with python you can utilise as well

2. Post detailed previews of path of building **pastebin** links and retreive detailed charcter info of any public character profile.  
  - PoB is as always a bit more detailed than character profile
  - It fetches all worn gear, jewels and gem links/groups
    - Todo: Flasks
